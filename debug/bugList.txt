bugs to fix. testcases to pass:

1) run. press 'removeNode' -> exception

2) choose group and owner properties for element - subGroups would be updated.
choose subGroup from list. then change owner (and/or) group properties so as subGroup got updated and dropped. if you press add element button the subgroup of element would be declared as the last one that've been chosen

3) 
		/**
		 * maybe there is a sense to define subGroups in .json file
		 * this way
		 * 	[..{
		 * 	'id': 'smth',
		 * 	'subGroup': 'smth',
		 * 	'group': 'smth',
		 * 	'owner': 'smth'
		 * 	}..]
		 *
		 * it allows to use $filter
		 *
		 * owners and groups would be stored separately (groups.json)
		 * so, editors would be formed using groups.json
